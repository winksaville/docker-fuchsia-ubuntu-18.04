# Create Docker image for building fuchsia (UNTESTED)

The list of requirements is from [here](sudo apt-get install curl git unzip)
all that is needed is "curl git zip" I added a few others. So the list
currently is: "curl git zip bsdmainutils tree vim sudo gnupg" as of this
writing. Check the Dockerfile for the "latest".

Another of my goals was to allow this image to share users
and groups between the host and docker image. This is going
to be specific to my host system so do NOT use this image directly.

To accomplish this the gids and uids must match and I've
create docker volumes to map the same file in both systems.
The result is:
```
wink@3900x:~/prgs/docker/fuchsia-ubuntu-18.04
$ id
uid=1000(wink) gid=985(users) groups=985(users),5(tty),98(power),150(wireshark),973(docker),987(uucp),988(storage),992(kvm),998(wheel),1001(sudo)
wink@3900x:~/prgs/docker/fuchsia-ubuntu-18.04
$ docker-compose run --rm -w `pwd` fuchsia
Creating fuchsia-ubuntu-1804_fuchsia_run ... done
wink@c53cec2288a6:~/prgs/docker/fuchsia-ubuntu-18.04
$ id
uid=1000(wink) gid=985(users) groups=985(users),1001(sudo)
```

## Repo

## Pull image from dockerhub (TBD not on docker hub)
```bash
docker pull winksaville/fuchsia:ub-18.04
```

## Build image locally

Clone the repo
```
git clone https://github/winksaville/docker-fuchsia-ubuntu-18.04.git fuchsia-ubuntu-18.04
```

```bash
cd fuchsia-ubuntu-18.04
docker build -t winksaville/fuchsia:ub-18.04 .
```

## Run image

The easy way to run the image is use docker-compose which
uses docker-compose.yml to set the volumes and the network
```bash
docker-compose run --rm -w `pwd` fuchsia
```

To manually run the image as the current user which is
equivalent to docker-compose above:
```bash
docker run --name fuchsia --user=$USER -v /home:/home -w `pwd` -v /etc/group:/etc/group:ro -v /etc/gshadow:/etc/gshadow:ro -v /etc/passwd:/etc/passwd:ro -v /etc/shadow:/etc/shadow:ro -v /etc/sudoers:/etc/sudoers:ro -v /etc/sudoers.d:/etc/sudoers.d:ro --rm -it winksaville/fuchsia:ub-18.04
```

## Push to dockerhub (TBD not on docker hub)
```bash
docker push winksaville/fuchsia:ub-18.04
```
